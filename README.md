* Pokemon Website is a website I made to practice HTML , jQuery, CSS, and responsive design. 
* It is based on an idea that Pokemons are real and everyone can go on an adventure with their selected Pokemon partners and document their adventure.

## Feature
* Responive Design
* User can view 10 new Pokemons everytime they re-visit the website and read about their information using Swiper
* User can view the community's posts about Pokemon encounters
* User can read about the Pokemon Trainers (to be implemented)
* User can read about their Pokemon Partners (to be implemented)
* User can read about items in the Pokmeon World (to be implemented)
* User can post their own Pokemon encounters (to be implemented)
